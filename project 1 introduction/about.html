      <p>
        Our team is made up of experienced developers, designers, project managers, marketing professionals, and support staff — all driven by a shared passion for innovation, quality, and collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what truly makes Hot Beans Web different is our Trainee Development Programme.
        We actively bring in new talent through our structured training system. Trainees join us in various roles — from front-end development and back-end coding to UX design, app development, and digital marketing. Under the guidance of our core team, they learn the ropes of the industry while contributing to real client projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        This model allows us to offer:
        <ul>
          <li>Fresh perspectives on every project</li>
          <li>Up-to-date knowledge on trends and technologies</li>
          <li>A dynamic team culture rooted in mentorship and growth</li>
        </ul>
        We believe that investing in people not only strengthens our company but also supports the wider tech community by preparing individuals for long-term careers in web development.
